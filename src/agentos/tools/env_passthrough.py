"""What of AgentOS's own environment a child process is allowed to see.

Every subprocess AgentOS spawns used to inherit ``os.environ`` verbatim — the
concern :mod:`agentos.env_policy` names in its opening paragraph, from the
other side. That means the provider key AgentOS authenticates with was sitting
in the environment of every ``exec_command`` the model ran, reachable by any
command that prints the environment and by every dependency those commands
load.

Three rules govern what crosses:

* **AgentOS's control surface never crosses.** The gateway token authenticates
  to the control plane, and the guard switches tell a child how the sandbox is
  configured — and let it reconfigure them for the next call. No child has a
  legitimate use for either, so they are stripped unconditionally.
* **Everything else crosses by default.** The user's own ``GITHUB_TOKEN``, AWS
  chain, or ``DOCKER_HOST`` are what makes the shell tool useful, and the local
  shell is the operator's own. Stripping by "does the name look secret" would
  break ``gh``, ``aws`` and ``terraform`` to protect nothing AgentOS owns.
* **Provider credentials cross unless the operator says otherwise.**
  ``AGENTOS_STRIP_PROVIDER_ENV=1`` removes the LLM, search, image, audio and
  embedding keys too. It is opt-in rather than the default because bundled
  skills read those names straight out of ``os.environ`` — see
  ``skills/bundled/seedance-2-prompt/scripts/generate_video.py`` — and their
  config fallback reads the same environment, so a user whose key lives in
  ``~/.agentos/.env`` would find those skills broken with no way to tell why.
  Closing that gap needs ``requires.envAny`` to be parsed into the skill model
  (today it is inert metadata) so the declarations below can cover it; until
  then the default stays where it does not break working installs. The leak
  that mattered most — an ``env`` dump landing in the transcript — is closed
  regardless, by the redaction in :func:`agentos.redact.redact_terminal_output`.

:func:`register_env_passthrough` opens a door in the other direction, for the
*allowlist* sandbox (``execute_code``) where the default is to forward almost
nothing: a skill that declares ``metadata.requires.env`` gets exactly those
names. A skill AgentOS did not ship cannot use it to reach AgentOS's own
credentials — asking for ``AGENTOS_LLM_API_KEY`` is asking to tunnel the
runtime's key into the sandbox that exists to contain untrusted code, and the
request is refused and logged. Bundled skills ship inside the wheel and their
frontmatter was reviewed as ours (the same trust split
:mod:`agentos.skills.publishers` already draws), so they register as trusted.
