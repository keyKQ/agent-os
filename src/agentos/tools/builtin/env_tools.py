"""Agent-facing environment tools.

``skill_list`` has always been able to tell the model *that* a skill needs
``BASE_RPC_URL``; it could not do anything about it. These two tools close
that gap, with the asymmetry the risk warrants:

* ``env_list`` is exposed by default and returns names and set/unset state.
  It carries no values at all — not even masked ones. Diagnosing "the skill
  is unavailable because X is missing" needs the name; it never needs the
  secret, and there is no reason to put one in a transcript.
* ``env_set`` is hidden by default and gated behind the approval queue. It
  writes a credential to disk on the operator's machine, so a human resolves
  it the same way they resolve a patch or a warnlisted command.

There is deliberately no reveal tool. A model that can read back stored
credentials is one prompt injection away from exfiltrating them, and nothing
an agent legitimately does requires it.
