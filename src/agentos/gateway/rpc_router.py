"""RPC handlers for user-directed Pilot Router tier holds.

Backs the /c0-/c3 and /auto slash commands and the chat composer's route
picker: a session-scoped tier hold set through the same
``RouterControlHoldStore`` the LLM-facing ``router_control`` tool uses, so
both paths share precedence semantics inside the router step.

Expiry is where the two paths deliberately part. A hold set here is marked
``HOLD_SOURCE_USER`` and is sticky — it survives until ``router.hold.clear``,
because a user who picks a route is stating an intent, not asking for a
ten-minute nudge. The model's own escalations keep the idle TTL so they decay
on their own. ``router.hold.get`` lets a reconnecting client read the pin back
rather than guessing, since the store is process memory the UI cannot see.

    ``router_control`` is transient in-turn state, not a setting the user chose,
