"""Write-side policy for environment variables.

:mod:`agentos.env` reads ``.env`` files. This module governs what may be
*written* back through an AgentOS surface — the Web UI, ``agentos env``, the
gateway RPC, or an agent tool.

Writing an environment variable is not a neutral convenience. Subprocesses
AgentOS spawns inherit most of ``os.environ`` (``tools/env_passthrough.py``
decides what is withheld), and several AgentOS behaviours — sandbox guards, the
shell allowlist, the gateway token — are themselves read from the environment.
A surface that can write any name is therefore a surface that can disable the
sandbox or execute arbitrary code on the next tool call.

The gate here is deliberately narrow and name-by-name:

* It applies on **write only**. Values an operator exported in their shell or
  hand-edited into ``~/.agentos/.env`` keep working exactly as before. The
  point is that the *writable* surface cannot escalate, not that the values
  become unusable.
* It does **not** blanket-block the ``AGENTOS_`` prefix. ``AGENTOS_LLM_API_KEY``
  is an ordinary credential that setup flows must be able to store. Only the
  specific names that steer runtime posture or state location are listed.
