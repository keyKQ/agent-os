"""LLM-judge router strategy: classify turns R0-R3 via a forced tool call.

Self-contained alternative to the local ML router (``pilot-v1``).
The judge builds its own provider client lazily via ``build_provider`` and
never re-enters TurnRunner, so recursion is structurally impossible. Errors,
unparseable output (after one repair re-prompt), and internal timeout all
degrade to the configured default tier with ``routing_source="judge_unavailable"``.

    (``<think>the user wants {json}</think>{"route_class":"R2",...}`` or
    ``Maybe {R1?} ... {valid json}``): the greedy span includes the stray brace,
    ``json.loads`` fails, and the parse returns None. This is the OPERATIVE parse
    path for exactly the judge targets that cannot honor a forced tool_choice
    (Ollama / local OpenAI-compatible endpoints), where reasoning traces wrap the

    Instead, walk the text and emit each top-level brace-balanced object span in
    order, ignoring braces inside JSON strings. The caller tries each candidate
    and takes the first that ``json.loads`` accepts, so a stray ``{maybe R1?}``
    before the real object is simply skipped.

    String state is tracked ONLY inside an object (``depth > 0``), where it must
    shield braces embedded in JSON string values. Outside any object
    (``depth == 0``) quotes are prose and are ignored: an UNBALANCED double-quote

    scanner in string state, which would swallow the real verdict's braces and
    return None. Prose-level quotes carry no structure, so skipping them here is
    always safe.

    When ``string_aware`` is False, string state is never entered — the scan is a
    pure brace balancer. This is the fallback for the pathological case where a
    stray quote AND stray braces interleave INSIDE what looks like an object span
    (``he said "{oops {"route_class":"R2"}``): string-aware scanning can still be
