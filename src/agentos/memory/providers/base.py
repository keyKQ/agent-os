"""Abstract base class for pluggable memory providers.

Memory providers give the agent persistent recall across sessions. The
provider manager (Task B2) enforces a one-external-provider limit to prevent
tool-schema bloat and conflicting memory backends.

External providers (mem0, and future backends) are registered and activated
via the ``memory.provider`` config key. Only one external provider runs at a
time. AgentOS wires the provider lifecycle through its async engine, so every
hook that touches the backend is ``async def`` and expected to be
non-blocking: queue latency-bound work rather than awaiting it inline on the
turn path.

Lifecycle (called by the provider manager, wired into the engine runtime):
  initialize()           — connect, create resources, warm up
  system_prompt_block()  — static text for the system prompt (sync, cheap)
  prefetch(query)        — background recall injected before each turn
  queue_prefetch(query)  — schedule the next turn's recall
  sync_turn(user, asst)  — async write after each turn
  get_tool_schemas()     — tool schemas to expose to the model
  handle_tool_call()     — dispatch a tool call
  shutdown()             — clean exit (drain queues, close connections)

Optional hooks (override to opt in):
  on_session_end(messages)                    — end-of-session extraction
  on_session_switch(new_session_id, **kwargs) — mid-process session_id rotation
  on_pre_compress(messages) -> str            — extract before compression
  on_memory_write(action, target, content)    — mirror curated memory writes

Future hooks (present in the hermes-agent original, deferred as YAGNI for v1
and intentionally not ported here): ``on_delegation`` (parent-side observation
of subagent work), ``backup_paths`` (extra on-disk paths to include in backup),
``get_config_schema`` / ``save_config`` (interactive setup walkthrough).
