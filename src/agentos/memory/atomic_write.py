"""Durable file writes for memory state.

``Path.write_text`` opens with ``"w"``, which truncates the file *before* the
new content is written. If the process dies in that window -- SIGKILL, OOM,
container stop, power loss -- the old content is already gone and the new
content never landed. For a file that is rewritten wholesale on every turn,
that window is hit on every turn.

Writing to a temporary file in the same directory and renaming it into place
removes the window: the rename is atomic, so a reader sees either the old
file or the new one, never a truncated one.
