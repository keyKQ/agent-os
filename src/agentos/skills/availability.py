"""Why a skill is — or is not — offered to the agent right now.

The engine used to answer this question only by side effect: a skill either
appeared in the injected prompt or vanished, with nothing recording which of
the five gates dropped it. This module owns both halves of the decision as
pure functions so the same code answers it twice — once for the turn that
builds the prompt, once for a UI asking before any turn has run.

Nothing here reads process state or mutates its inputs; given the same skills,
tools and eligibility context it returns the same answer every time.
