"""One inventory builder for every "what skills does this install have" surface.

``skills.list``, ``skills.status``, ``skills.get``, the ``skill_list`` tool, and
``agentos skills list`` each used to assemble their own answer, which is why they
disagreed: only one of them read the lockfile, so a hub-installed skill looked
like an ordinary local directory everywhere else. This module derives the whole
row once — eligibility, acquisition, publisher — and every surface renders the
same facts.

Nothing here is cached. Acquisition depends on the lockfile, which changes
without any ``SKILL.md`` mtime changing, so the skill snapshot deliberately does
not carry it; see :class:`~agentos.skills.types.SkillAcquisition`.
