"""A bundled skill's script has to be where its SKILL.md says it is.

Nothing else checks this. A skill vendored from upstream arrives pointing at
wherever upstream kept its helper — ``~/.claude/skills/<name>/analyze.py`` in
the case that prompted these tests — and that path exists on nobody's machine
once the skill ships inside the wheel. The manifest still parses, the skill
still loads, the Skills page still lists it; the only symptom is the agent
running the documented command and getting "No such file or directory" at the
one moment a user asked it for something.

``{baseDir}`` is what the tool layer substitutes for the skill's own directory,
so it is the only correct way for instruction text to reach a shipped script.
