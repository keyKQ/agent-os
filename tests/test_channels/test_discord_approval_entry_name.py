"""Regression test: Discord approval sessionKey binding hardcodes "discord".

``_handle_discord_component_interaction`` checks
``session_channel != "discord"`` -- a hardcoded literal -- instead of the
configured channel entry's actual name, unlike the Telegram and MSTeams
handlers which correctly compare against ``self.config.name``.

Session keys embed the *configured entry name* (``ChannelManager.
_build_session_key`` -> ``session.keys.build_group_key(channel=entry.name,
...)``), which is a required field with no default
(``ConfiguredChannelEntry.name: str``) -- every real deployment sets it
explicitly, and any multi-account Discord setup necessarily has at least
one entry not literally named "discord" (dict keys must be unique). For
any such entry, every approve/deny click is wrongly rejected as a
"mismatch" even though it is the correct, intended approver -- the pending
tool-call approval is never resolved.
