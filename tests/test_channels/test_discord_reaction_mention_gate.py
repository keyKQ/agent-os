"""A reaction in a guild channel/thread carries no text, so the generic
``is_mentioned(msg.content)`` check is always ``False`` there -- the
group-mention gate (``_should_skip_unmentioned``) would otherwise drop
*every* reaction in *every* guild channel or thread, even one added to a
message the bot itself just sent. Reacting to the bot's own message is
already an unambiguous, directed response to it, equivalent to being
mentioned, and must not be gated out.
