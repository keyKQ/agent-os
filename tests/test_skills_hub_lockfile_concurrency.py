"""Concurrent read-modify-write safety for the skills lockfile (#1557).

Two installs racing on `Lockfile.load()` -> mutate -> `Lockfile.save()` with
no locking means the second write can silently clobber the first's entry
instead of merging. `Lockfile.update()` holds an exclusive OS-level lock
across the whole cycle so concurrent writers serialize instead of racing.
