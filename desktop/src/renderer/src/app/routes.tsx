// Hash routing: the packaged app loads index.html from disk (file://), where
// history-based routing has no server to fall back to.
//
// Home and a session share ONE route (`sessions/:key?`) on purpose: the first
// send navigates from the keyless home to `/sessions/<key>` and React Router
// keeps the same element mounted, so the composer docks with an animation
// instead of remounting.
//
// Scheduled jobs and Settings are not routes: they are sheets over the
// window (AppShell), so opening one never leaves the conversation underneath.
//
// A project is a page (`projects/:id`), reached from its folder in the
// sidebar: its brief and the chats filed in it.
